# 🔍 Search Select

A lightweight **vanilla JavaScript** plugin that transforms your regular `<select>` element into a **searchable, multi-select dropdown** — no dependencies, no frameworks, pure JS.

It automatically waits for options to load dynamically (like an image `onload`), and supports live filtering, keyboard shortcuts, and multiple selection.
